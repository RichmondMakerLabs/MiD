Zocus Camera Rig (c) 2016 Jude Pullen

The Zocus rig is useful to any Photograph/Film enthusiast, although the device was originally developed for James Dunn as part of BBC Twoâ€™s series, The Big Life Fix with Simon Reeve. 

James is passionate about photography, but who also has a condition called Epidermolysis Bullosa, which makes his skin to be very sensitive to even slight pressure. This causes James severe pain and considerable frustration when trying to operate fiddly camera buttons or scroll/jog-wheels. 

In the programme the rig is used with the Zocus app which allows you to wirelessly control the zoom and focus of your DSLR camera, via Bluetooth, on iPad or iPhone (Android coming soon).  See http://www.zocus.co.uk
